   - System-wide keyboard automation (typing, shortcuts)
   - Mouse control (clicking, moving, scrolling)
   - Application management (launch, close, focus)
   - Window management (minimize, maximize, resize)

2. Advanced Features
   - 3D CAD generation from voice prompts (parametric models)
   - 3D printing integration (slicing and wireless printing)
   - Web browser automation (autonomous browsing)
   - Smart home control (Kasa devices)
   - Gesture control (MediaPipe hand tracking)
   - Visual analysis (real-time scene understanding)

**Technology Stack:**
- Backend: Python 3.11, FastAPI, Socket.IO
- AI: Google Gemini 2.5 Native Audio
- Computer Control: PyAutoGUI, pygetwindow, psutil

1. Complete local control - no cloud dependency for core features
2. Multi-modal interaction (voice, gesture, visual)
3. Integrated workflow (design → fabricate → automate)
4. Privacy-first architecture
5. Open source and customizable

**Deck Structure (10-12 slides):**
1. Title slide with tagline
2. The Problem (current AI assistants are limited)
3. The Solution (Multivac's capabilities overview)
4. Product Demo Flow (visual journey)
5. Key Features (computer control, CAD, automation)
6. Technology Architecture (simple diagram)
7. Use Cases (3-4 compelling scenarios)
8. Competitive Advantage
9. Market Opportunity
10. Roadmap (future features)
11. Call to Action (GitHub, community)
12. Contact/Thank You

**Design Guidelines:**
- Modern, tech-forward aesthetic
