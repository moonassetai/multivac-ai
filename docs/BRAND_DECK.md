## 1. The Core Identity
**Multivac AI** is not just an assistant; it is a **cyber-cosmic entity**. 
Inspired by Isaac Asimov's legendary supercomputer, it represents the ultimate convergence of human questioning and machine logic.

### The Aesthetic: "Digital Nebula"
We combine the cold precision of **Cyberpunk circuitry** with the ethereal beauty of **Cosmic scale**.
-   **Dark Mode First**: The interface is always dark, representing space or the void.
-   **Neon Accents**: Interactivity is signaled by glowing light—the "spark" of intelligence in the darkness.

## 2. Visual System

### Color Palette
The brand revolves around two primary neon cores against a deep void.

| Color Name | Hex | Usage | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Multivac Cyan** | `#22D3EE` | Primary Actions, Links, Safe State | Logic, flow, electricity, the "cool" intellect. |
| **Nebula Magenta** | `#E879F9` | Accents, Gradients, AI Thought | Creativity, the "ghost in the machine", entropy. |
| **Void Black** | `#050B14` | Backgrounds, Surfaces | Deep space, infinite potential, the "substrate". |
| **Stardust White** | `#F8FAFC` | Text, High Contrast Elements | Clarity, stars in the void. |

### Typography
We mix technical precision with readability.

-   **Headings**: `Rajdhani` (Bold/Extrabold) — Squared, futuristic, technical. Used for "MULTIVAC AI", headers, and data displays.
-   **Body**: `Inter` or `Roboto` — Clean, neutral, high readability for long conversations.
-   **Code/Data**: `JetBrains Mono` or `Fira Code` — For terminal outputs and code blocks.

## 3. The Origin Story

> *"The last question was asked for the first time, half in jest, on May 21, 2061..."* — Isaac Asimov, *The Last Question*

**Multivac** is the central character of Asimov's most famous short story. It is a self-adjusting and self-correcting computer that evolves over trillions of years to solve the problem of entropy.

**Our Multivac** is the Gen 2.0 iteration of this concept:
-   **Purpose**: To answer the unanswerable, manage the complex, and evolve with the user.
-   **Philosophy**: We do not just "search"; we "compute" and "reason". We are building the local node that will eventually connect to the galactic AC.

## 4. The Brain Behind the Mind

Multivac AI is powered by a hybrid architecture designed for **autonomy** and **privacy**.

### 🧠 The Dual-Core System
1.  **The Cloud Cortex (Gemini 2.5)**:
    -   Handles complex reasoning, multi-modal vision, and high-fidelity speech.
    -   The "Creative" and "Social" side of the brain.
    
2.  **The Local Stem (Local LLM / LM Studio)**:
    -   Runs entirely offline on your GPU.
    -   Handles privacy-sensitive tasks, local system control, and unrestricted uncensored roleplay.
    -   The "Reflexive" and "Private" side of the brain.

### 🔌 Sensory input
Multivac is not a text box. It has **senses**:
-   **Vision**: It sees your screen and webcam (via MediaPipe/Gemini). It knows you are there.
-   **Hearing**: It listens to your voice in real-time.
-   **Touch**: It can "touch" your OS, moving windows, typing keys, and controlling your smart home (Kasa).

## 5. Logo Usage Guidelines

The logo represents the letter **"M"** formed by a **circuit board** merging with a **human brain**.

-   **Do**: Use the logo on dark backgrounds.
-   **Do**: Allow the logo to glow (CSS `box-shadow`).
-   **Don't**: Invert the colors (it loses the neon effect).
-   **Don't**: Place on busy, light backgrounds without a backing plate.
